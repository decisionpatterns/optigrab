* Use match.arg for matching flags?  I don't like this idea as it gets

  1  Most common
  n  A specific number
  n = up.to(3)

If greedy is used ... we should warn about args.

* Read from config file:
  * Prompt?
  * Search on local?
  An option can come from .rc, CLO, prompt or setting.  
  If it is interactive

X  Drop the 'coerce' argument from 'grabOpt' since it is no different from
  wrapping the call in an as.* function.
